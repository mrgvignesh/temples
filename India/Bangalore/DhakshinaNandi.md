# Sri Dakshinamukha Nandi Temple

Brief / Āmukham (आमुखम्) :  
Sri Dakshinamukha Nandi Teertha Kalyani Kshetra is an ancient, hidden temple in Bangalore's Malleswaram neighborhood.
It is popurlarly known for its unique, south-facing Nandi statue from which Water mysteriously flows onto a Shivalinga below and into a stepped tank called a Kalyani. 
The temple itself is over 400 years old and was rediscovered and unearthed by residents in 1997.  You can read more about this [temple] (https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297628-d4401138-Reviews-DakshinaMukhy_Nandeeshwara_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html)

  
Worship & Rituals :
+ Evening Arathi at 7:00PM - I was spellbounc by the visual splendour of this ritual with the priest offering 3 different special arathi's and with the chants of "Om Nama Shivaya" from devotees.
  It sets the perfect mood to realize the Shiva within us and background of the Raja mela thalam just aids the self-discovery process.
+ Kalyani / Water Tank - The water from Nandi falls on to the Shiva statue and gets collected at this tank just besides the Shivling.
  This is unlike typical other south indian temples, where the temple tank is built with in temple premises usually on the north eastern direction.
  Water collected in this tank is very clear, but the attraction is presence of fishes and turtles.
+ Teertha as Prasadam - You can collect the teertha from the Kalyani water tank or also buy from the priest (for about Rs 50/-). It is reverred to have medicinal properties.
+ Southern-facing Nandi - Unlike most temples where Nandi faces the Shivalinga, this bull faces south, hence the name "Dakshinamukha" )
+ Near by Kshetra's - It is situated in front of the Gangamma temple and opposite the Kadu Malleshwara temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Temple.
+ My preferred worship sequence reflects a journey: starting with Gangamma (the source of water), moving to Dakshina Mukha Nandi (the harmony of life),
  creating the Kadu Malleswara (the flourishing forest/heaven), and finally surrendering to Lakshmi Narasimha for protection and wealth.
