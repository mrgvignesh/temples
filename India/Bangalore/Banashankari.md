Āmukham (आमुखम्) :  
Shree Banashankari Devi Temple  - Dedicated to Goddess Banashankari (an incarnation of Parvati), is a highly revered Hindu temple in Bangalore, known for its tranquil atmosphere and large number of devotees.
The temple was built in 1915 by Somanna Shetty, who brought the idol of Goddess Banashankari from Badami, where her original and ancient temple is located. It is believed the presiding deity chose this place 
as her abode. The temple is generally open in two shifts, from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. daily and there is large influx of devotees on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

Worship & Rituals :
+ Wish fulfilling Peedam - The deity is believed to fulfill the sincere prayers of her devotees swiftly. There is peedam under the Sthala Vriksha (sacred tree) with the imprint of Goddess feet. Here we have to make a prayer and
  clasp the peedam with our palms in the groove and it is believed that devotees must only concentrate on Devi and we subconsciously move our hand around the grove and complete the circle. It is believed Devi only allows righteous devotees to complete the circle.
+ Closing Pooja (Arthajama) - Everyday at the closing time, Devi is given rest with sweet lullaby. Atmosphere is divine at this moment, as all devotees not to make any noise and we can see the Devi in her Nijaroopa i.e
 see Devi in her true or unadorned form, without the usual decorative coverings.
+ Suprabhatha Seva - a special early morning ritual performed to awaken the Devi from her celestial sleep. Priests recite the Suprabhatam hymns to gently wake the deity abd then perform Abhishegam. 
+ My preferred worship - I prefer the profound stillness of the closing puja or the early morning puja (Suprabhata Seva); these times, free from commotion, allow a deeper connection with the Devi.
  The chilly, fresh atmosphere of Bangalore's early morning adds to this divinity, making the sight of the Devi in her Ekantha form an essential, personal experience.
