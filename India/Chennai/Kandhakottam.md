# Shree Kandaswamy Temple

Brief / Āmukham (आमुखम्) :  
Shree Kandaswamy Temple or [Arulmigu Muthukumaraswamy Devasthanam] (https://veludharan.blogspot.com/2022/12/sri-kandaswamy-temple-kandhakottam.html)  - Dedicated to lord Muruga / Skanda / Karthikeya.  
The temple was built in 1670 (17th century) by Mari Chettiar in the present George Town (Parry's Corner) of Chennai / Madras.  Idol of Murugan is believed to have been brought from the famous Tiruporur Murugan temple. 
The temple is open from around 5:30 AM to 12:30 PM and again from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM.


Worship & Rituals :
+ Origin -  temple's origin is tied to two ardent devotees of Lord Murugan ,  Velur Mari Chettiar (a merchant) and his friend Kandappa Achari. 
The two friends regularly made the monthly pilgrimage from Madras (Chennai) to the ancient Tirupporur Murugan Temple (located on the Old Mahabalipuram Road).
One day, around the 1670s, while resting under a tree on their way to Tirupporur, they had a divine dream in which Lord Murugan appeared. 
The deity instructed them that his idol could be found in an ant-hill near a tank bund at Tirupporur, and that they should take it to Madras for worship.
Following this dream, they discovered the idol, brought it back to Madras, and consecrated it in the garden of a man named Muthiyalu Naicken in the area that is now Park Town.
+ Construction - Mari Chettiar took the initiative to build a permanent structure for the deity. To fund the construction of the original temple, he is said to have sold his wife's jewelry.
 and land donation came from Muthiyalu Naicken, where the initial installation took place and subsequently donated the sorrunding land (covering approximately eight acres) upon which the present temple stands.

+ Utsava Moorthy / Muthukumarasamy - Muthukumarasamy is the Utsava moorthy here is very special as he personates in unfinished form. 
The sthapathi had made and found some metals protruding like spikes. When the sthapathi tried to clear with a tool, he experienced shock. 
The Utsava Murti was kept in a locked room. 
One day, Sambayyar, who was well-versed in Vedas, from Kasi, came and saw the Utsava Murti. 
With the permission of the Trustees, Sambayyar cleared the spikes through the chanting of Mantras. 
+ My preferred worship - The closing ceremony, known as the Palli Arai Pooja or the final puja, is my favorite part of visiting the temple. 
It's when the surrounding bustling neighborhood settles down, and the deep connection with Lord Kandaswamy is most profound.
  + Celestial Bath: Lord Kandaswamy is given a quick celestial bath, or Abhishekam, using sacred liquids like milk and rose water (Paneer).
  + Procession: After the Arathi (waving of lights), the Lord is ceremonially taken to the Palliyarai (the ceremonial chamber), which is beautifully adorned with flowers. This marks the end of his public darshan for the day, as he retires for the night.
  + Devotional Atmosphere: During the procession, the temple crowd chants "Arokara", a sound that fills the space and allows for a moment of deep spiritual connection.
  + Distribution of Prasadam: The ceremony concludes as the priest distributes the holy offering (Prasadam), typically consisting of sweet milk and appam.
